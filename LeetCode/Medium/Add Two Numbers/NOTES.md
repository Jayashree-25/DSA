          Add Two Numbers

          - Summary: This Java code adds two numbers represented as linked lists. It uses the ListNode data structure to represent the numbers, where each node stores a digit. The algorithm iterates through both lists simultaneously, adding digits and handling carry-overs. A dummy head node simplifies the process of returning the resulting linked list.

          - Time Complexity: O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the two input linked lists. This is because the algorithm iterates through the lists once, performing constant-time operations at each step.
          - Space Complexity: O(max(m, n)) in the worst case. This is because the resulting linked list can have a length of up to max(m, n) + 1 (to accommodate a potential carry-over).  The space used for other variables is constant.
